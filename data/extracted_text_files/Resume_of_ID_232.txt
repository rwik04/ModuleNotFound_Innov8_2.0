The dojo I work at was sold to new owners in 2015; I stayed on board with the new owners and have improved many areas of their
business.
The biggest improvements I made were things that save them money.Â  The martial arts school I work at used a website that charged them
$300 a month for information that was just not needed and therefore a waste of money.Â  I came up with our own in house system.
I identified what information (tuition, attendance, rank, student's info etc.) we needed on a daily basis, and how to get to that information
quickly.Â  I simply used the excel program, came up with a sheet for each class and modify it to be easy to use for anyone.
We can access any information we need quickly and timely; without paying this website.
We were paying a lot for internet and phone.Â  I called around and verified price and contract for a commercial account.Â  I was able to
negotiate a great price and bundle our services.
We sell a lot of merchandise at the martial arts gym.Â  I set up all new whole sale accounts; for equipment and uniform needs.Â  I
researched pricing for equipment, uniforms and office needs (ink, paper, paper towels) and modified our suppliers.Â  I was able to establish
new relationships and new pricing.
The dojo relocated in 2016.Â  When we took over a new space; I planned everything.Â  The bathroom remodel I came up with the
complete redesign and ,some of the construction, I actually did myself.
I handled every aspect of moving from one location to a new location.Â  In a time limit of 14 days, we not only moved but opened our
doors at new location; all during Christmas/New Year Holiday.
Since working for ATA, I have revised the way we communicate to students and parents.Â  I updated our facebook web page, came out
with a monthly newsletter, put in place an announcement board, and update our webpage bi-weekly.
I have planned and executed new rank testings, tournaments, birthday parties, and planned our company events for an entire year in
advance.
I have increased customer satisfaction and supported customers in areas such as conflict resolution in tuition issues, problem solved our
cancel and hold policy, resolved our turnaround time on merchandise orders, clarified rules and equipment requirements in writing and
revamped our leadership program.
IÂ manage new student recruitment, marketing needs, student registration, community outreach, parent communications, staff management,ordering supplies, bookkeeping, upgrade selling, and receiving payments Improved family and parent relations for the school.Â  I created
and implemented new schedule, new calendar of events, worked closely with the owners to design and publish the company's website
