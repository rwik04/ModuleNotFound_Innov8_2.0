Company Name
Provides oversight for state operated and private facilities licensed or 
contracted with the Department of Mental Health Developed the
Advocacy Conditional Release Monitoring Program with 
immediate success by locating and reporting consumers that are non-compliant
with medication, court orders and state rules Carefully analyzing historical comments, ratings and input from consumers using 
the grievance
process allowed us to highlight negative trends prior to becoming 
major problems, as a result the number of consumer grievances dropped
almost 
50% since being appointed Advocate General Monitoring and reviewing critical incident reports from facilities resulted in a
collaboration that prompted facility representatives to engage consumers and 
families to offer assistance, an explanation or other appropriate
support that 
soothed initial anger and potentially prevented lawsuits.
This was a huge factor in 
the 34% decrease in critical incidents being reported from 8/2014 to 8/2015 Collaborating with the Oklahoma
Forensic Review Board regarding 
consumers found not guilty by reason of insanity while providing input and 
advice on current behaviors
and trends strengthened relationships between the 
governor appointed board and the department By participating in treatment team
meetings of consumers found not guilty by 
reason of insanity and those never to attain competency, focusing on risk 
assessments,
progression through the program and potential placement for the 
consumers, we were able to streamline the phases of the program making it
more 
productive and efficient Staying aware of the state budget status, I was able to make appropriate 
adjustments while managing this
division's budget.
As a result this division 
finished the fiscal year 20% under budget allowing the savings to be passed on to 
divisions where services were
being cut.
