CUSTOMER ADVOCATE
Professional Summary
I was in R.O.T.C for 4 years in high school. I Was in our unarmed drill team, I was second in command. I would be 
in drill meets and in
competitions. Not only was this distraction for me but it was also a learning experience for me. I gathered leader ship skills, team work skills, also
responsibility skills. When we needed to get something done I 
was taught to take the initiative to get things done. I did lead a couple of our drill
meets. I did learn how to handle 
hard situations.
