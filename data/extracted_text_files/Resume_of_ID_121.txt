Information Technology Computer System Administrator (This
is a federal job) Supervisor Sandy Spiers (801-620-4555) May Contact Supervisor: Yes.
My responsibilities were to assist public electronic filing programmers by analyzing, diagnosing and making proposals on error in software to
getting there software to passing the IRS standards for electronic filing.
I did this by using IRS IRM and thereby have them transmit standard test returns then I would have to print out there transmitted test returns
and analyses and determine where there programming error's 
were and call them and 
communicate to them where the error occurred.
They would make the correction and it would be accepted as an Electronic Filing Software Program.
I also work closely with the electronic filing Tax Examiners in assisting the transmitters in problem solving their situation.
Another responsibility I had was to have all of the data copied to a nine-track tape and processed on the mainframe computer from that
output then we had to drain the information on to an archival system that allowed the authorized I.R.S 
employees to access the returns if a
taxpayer had questions about their returns.
I also helped my group to maintain our network and desktop computers.
There were times we would lose connection to the network and we would have to use a network sniffer that would assist us on the type and
location of the problem that needed to be fixed.
I also would install updates to the workstations, as they became available to us thru download transmittal.
