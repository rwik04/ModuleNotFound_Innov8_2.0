SENIOR ADVISOR AND NATIONAL FUNDRAISING DIRECTOR
Professional Summary
I am an agile and hungry project manager with nearly five years of experience leading cross-functional teams in the political campaign world. In that
time, I have managed concurrent projects at various stages of development, designed and oversaw the maintenance of project plans, and
leveraged qualitative and quantitative data insights to inform decision making. My experience embedding on a new campaign every few months has
made me an expert at drinking from the fire hose. At my heart, I am a people person and problem solver who loves to operate in ambiguous roles
and will run through walls to deliver.
