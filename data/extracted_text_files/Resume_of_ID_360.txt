IT MANAGER
Summary
Ten years of management experience with a focus on team building and project management. Ten years of experience as a network engineer and
systems administrator. The majority of my experience has been working with Microsoft, Dell, HP, IBM, Symantec, McAfee, Trend Micro and
Cisco hardware and software business solutions. I have extensive experience with Microsoft Exchange Server. I am comfortable with Cisco
command line IOS, VoIP, QoS tagging, layer 2, 3 and 4 switching and packet shaping. I have used Fluke OptiView, Wireshark, NetFlow
Analyzer, Solarwinds Network Performance Monitor and SMS to assist me in the process of identifying network bottlenecks and performance
issues. I have experience in business, education, medical and manufacturing environments. Recently, I have been working a great deal with Hyper-
V, VMware and data loss prevention software.
