I oversee the purchasing, management, and maintenance of all infrastructure-related hardware and software, while simultaneously overseeing
end-user hardware and software support for a law school with roughly 85 FTE faculty/staff, and 275 students with a roughly 1:1 PC:Mac

service and maintenance contracts, while also developing and maintaining IT policies as they relate to law school operations and academics.
Duties include managing a 5-host, 40-server VMWare farm, help desk system, network monitoring system, campus-wide physical/building
security system, ID card system, printing infrastructure, electronic exam system, backing up all critical data on the UNH Law network, and
administering a plethora of fileservers, webservers and web applications, including various content management systems.
I work with system administrators in Durham to design and maintain the entire network on the Concord campus.

Associate Director of Computer Services

to 
09/2014
Primary responsibilities included the day-to-day support of end-user hardware, software, and peripherals in a mixed Microsoft Windows,
Mac OS X, linux, and Novell environment, while also assisting with the everyday demands of maintaining a rather complex campus-wide
network that was driven by a predominately Cisco infrastructure.
Reported directly to, and served as the immediate backup for the Director of Computer Services.
Designed and implemented the first ever wireless network on campus, which I administered and upgraded through three different platform
changes over the course of thirteen years.
Planned and administered the campus upgrade initiatives from Windows 98 to Windows XP, Windows XP to Windows 7, and numerous
Mac OS and iOS version upgrades.
After Franklin Pierce Law Center integrated with UNH, I developed the plan for and administered the transition from a predominately
Novell-based infrastructure to a predominately Microsoft-based infrastructure, including transitioning our e-mail platform from Novell
GroupWise to Microsoft Exchange.
