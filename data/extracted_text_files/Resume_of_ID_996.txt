MIDDLE SCHOOL PRINCIPAL
Executive Profile
To obtain the job that continues to expand my administrative experience working with staff, students and parents to develop a shared vision and
leading school community in achieving those goals. I firmly believe that all children deserve to have every opportunity to learn in a positive,
supportive environment as well as have a multitude of opportunities to discover and explore areas of interest helping them to develop into a well-
rounded individual who will succeed in the twenty-first century. 
I believe that true leaders exhibit habits of mind and model the expectations they
have of their employees. I believe two critical components of successful leadership are positive relationships and transparency.
