INSTRUCTIONAL COACH
Summary
I am a passionate, hard-working educator with over 30 years of experience in curriculum, instruction, and professional development. I have
worked as an elementary teacher, Sacramento County Office of Education Curriculum Specialist, and instructional coach, providing on-site
support and professional development for teachers and administrators throughout the state. Most recently, I have focused on helping districts
transition to the Common Core State Standards, and I have led numerous trainings on their implementation and effective use in the classroom.
