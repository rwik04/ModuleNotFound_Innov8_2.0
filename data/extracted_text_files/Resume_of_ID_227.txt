To Whom It May Concern, 
The intent of this letter is to express my
professional regards for Mr.
William Hale.
I have known Mr.
Hale for over 
a year in 
academic milieu.
During this period I have had the pleasure of being associated with one of the finest people that anyone 
could ever come in contact with.
William's technical and professional prowess has accorded him the highest regards from his peers.
He has a thorough 
understanding of the job requirements and how to accomplish corporate goals without sacrificing individual creativity.
William is not only a success in his career, but is always interested in the betterment of his fellow man.
I have observed him many times in the process of accomplishing things that truly are representative of a person with a strong 
family and
moral convictions.
William is a man that can wear many hats, and his humbleness allows him to be a good server, 
and at times adapt to the position of a leader.
I am deeply impressed by Mr.
Hale and recommend him unhesitatingly.
I am confident that, if selected for your vacancy, he 
would provide the same high level of service and commitment.
Sincerely 
Yours, 
Jose' M.
